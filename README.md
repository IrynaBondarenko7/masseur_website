# Massage Therapist Website

The website is built using HTML, CSS (Sass), JavaScript, and the Parsel build
tool. It includes four main sections: "About Me," "Equipment," "Procedures," and
"Contact." Additionally, there is a "Book Appointment" button on the homepage
that opens a modal window with a feedback form. The form sends messages to the
therapist's email using Formspree. The website also utilizes the AOS (Animate On
Scroll) library for animations, which is loaded via a CDN, and custom JavaScript
scripts.

used during massage sessions. It provides details about the quality and range of
equipment available in the therapist's studio.

The "Procedures" section outlines the various massage procedures and techniques
offered by the therapist. Visitors can get an idea of what to expect during a
massage session and choose the one that suits their needs.

## Contacts

The "Contacts" section allows visitors to contact the therapist. It contains
contact information, such a location and a link to the therapist's Instagram
profile.

## Booking an Appointment

On the homepage, there is a prominent "Book Appointment" button. Clicking this

Formspree service.
